            <h1 class="portfolio-section-caps-heading">DEFINING THE PROBLEM</h1>
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Introduction</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Journy is a mobile app that helps people suffering from mental illnesses track their mood everyday. When users rate their mood, they have the option to journal their thoughts or try out suggested activities like meditation and exercise to improve mental health.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Problem</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">I chose to create a solution for the mental health space since <b>more than 6.7 million people live with a mental health condition in Canada</b> (MHCC, 2013). Typically, healthy living is associated with physical health, but mental health is just as important. Even though there are many people living with mental health illnesses, <b>40% of people who experience symptoms do not seek help </b>(MHCC, 2013). This is due to <b>stigma</b> and a high barrier of entry (i.e. booking appointments with doctors) so this app is meant to be a low barrier starting point to begin the process of improving mental health. </p>
          </div>


          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Target Audience</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">The target audience is people who want to improve their mental health but may be hesitant to seek help. Since the largest demographic of people experiencing mental illness are 15-24 year olds, the design uses friendly characters to guide through this journey (MHCC, 2013).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Currently, there are many <b>mood tracker apps that have oversimplified views of human emotions</b>. For example, Daylio, an app that has over 200K users, only uses emotions like “Rad, Good, Meh, Bad, Awful” but not all emotions fall into these. Additionally, most of these apps display mood statistics or let you journal about your emotions, but this doesn’t directly help alleviate anxious or depressive symptoms. This is where I saw a potential wedge for something new.<br><br>

I started researching possibilities to improve mental health symptoms. I came across “Calm”, rated as #2 in the App Store, a simple app where users can freely browse calming music and meditation tracks to improve mindset and well being. The reviews were extremely positive, and people found it very helpful to improve their moods. Doing more research, I discovered that according to a medically reviewed article written by Holland (2019), <b>exercise and self care routines can improve mental health symptoms significantly</b>.<br><br>

With all of this in mind, I decided to create a solution that <b>bridged mood rating apps and helpful activities for improving mindset and mental health</b>. This solution is an accessible way for people to recieve help which will act as a starting point for their journey in improving mental health. In my solution, I will also fix the mood rating to encompass a larger range of human emotion.

          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Solution</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">My solution is a mobile app that serves as an electronic journal for users to log their emotions, any depressive/anxious symptoms and journal their thoughts. Based off of the mood and symptoms, the app will suggest activities known to help improve mental health such as yoga, meditation, making a healthy snack, taking a walk or even reading a book. Users can re-rate their emotions after the activity so the app can improve the suggestion algorithm overtime if certain tasks seem to be more helpful.

            </a><br>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Users are reminded by the app everyday to rate their mood. These notifications are an example of using the hook canvas which is important when trying to be consistent to build feedback loops and habits to help the user continually improve their mental health by using the guidance by the app. They can manage these notifications and their frequency in the settings.
            </p>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">According to a research paper, there are 8 basic mood types for human emotion. This should solve the problem of very vague moods in other competitive apps
  (Desmet, 2015).
            </p>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Additionally, users will select symptoms they may possibly have since it is hard to self identify anxiety and depression. This will let the app get a better idea of what to suggest to improve mood later.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">There is a journaling option for users to log their thoughts about that day. If they don’t feel like writing that day, they can skip writing.

            </a><br>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">It has been determined through research that accomplishing small tasks like tidying can help anxious or depressive symptoms. Self care routines like meditation, reading, breathing and exercise can also help. Journy will suggest activities based off of the mood and symptoms felt by the user. Sometimes people with anxiety and depression can feel overwhelmed by tasks so users have the option to skip it if they’re not up for it.

            </a><br>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">If users complete an activity, they are prompted to re-rate their mood so the app can better improve activity suggestions based on trends in mood and symptoms felt at the time.

            </a><br>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Since there is stigma around mental health illnesses, and since the target audience are high school and university students, a time where self image is important, I designed an option for users to password protect their app which can be configured in settings. There is an option to use touch ID to reduce the amount of form entry. For newer phones, face ID can also be configured. Once logged in, they can access their home screen where they can view past journal entires and create new ones.

            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Colour Choices</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">I chose to use a a teal-green for my primary colour since green is typically associated with life, renewal, freshness and safety which I felt  would help users feel calm and a sense of growth as their mental health improved. As the secondary colour, I chose a pale orange colour since orange is associated with joy, warmth, change, encouragement, health and happiness which was what the app was trying to help users achieve. Overall, I kept the colours of the app very light and pastel to be warm yet calming.

            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Through this design challenge, I learned a lot about mental health and ways to improve anxious or depressive symptoms by self care routines. I learned about colours that would help users feel comfortable and safe as well as wording that made users feel secure as well.
