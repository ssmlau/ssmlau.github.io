        <h3 class="case-study-small-header">INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">About Toronto Cat Rescue (TCR)</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">This large-scale Toronto based non-profit finds homes for ~2700 cats per year with the help of ~1100 volunteers. They have a network of 400+ foster homes that act as temporary housing for the cats until they can find permanent care.</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">How I Got Involved</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">During my design internship at Wayfair, one of my coworkers, Nataly, posted on Slack that she was looking for a designer to volunteer their time. I jumped at the chance since who doesn‚Äôt love cats üê±?</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Project Goal</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Currently, there is no custom technology used for managing this large scale operation so the goal of this project was to design a streamlined and centralized system to easily track and manage cats.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"><b>Project KPIs</b></p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Reduce time to enter data and reduce data duplication and errors.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="case-study-small-header">PEOPLE ON THE PROJECT</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">The Team</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">We are a 6 person team. My coworker from Wayfair who volunteers at the shelter, Nataly, leads the infra team of 3 other student developers and is also the product manager.</p><div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
       <p class="case-study-paragraph">For the design team, Miguel is the other designer working on the project with me.</p>
       <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">My Role</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">In this project, Miguel and I have worked collaboratively together on all the different stages. We took turns leading the user interviews with the TCR volunteer leads and synthesized the information together after. </p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Currently, we are both working on design explorations and bouncing ideas off each other to get feedback. Then, we will decide on a few options to start user testing with the volunteers.</p>

        <h3 class="case-study-small-header">PROJECT CHALLENGES</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Technical and Design Constraints</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">No API for Integration</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">Spreadsheets and PetPoint are used to manage and track cats. After a cat has been adopted, they‚Äôre completely moved over to PetPoint (an industry standard data management system) to get the cat microchip, apply for a pet license and archive the cat. PetPoint uses per-seat licensing, which is too expensive for ~1100 volunteers and there is no API to integrate any solution we create with this software.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Unfamiliar with Technology</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">Majority of the volunteers are older adults that are unfamiliar with technology, so it is important for the designs to be accessible, explicit and reduce cognitive load.</p>

      <h3 class="case-study-small-header">RESEARCH</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">User Interviews</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">After gathering some context from Nataly, Miguel and I had a lot of questions about how the whole process worked. We interviewed each of the volunteer leads and the TCR Vice President.</p><div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"><b>We held 7 one hour long interviews where we asked people to walk us through their job and to verbalize their frustrations aloud</b>.</p>

        <h3 class="case-study-small-header">SYNTHESIS</h3>
        <h1 class="case-study-large-header">About the Process</h1>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">We discovered that this entire large scale operation was managed through spreadsheets and email. PetPoint, an enterprise software was used to manage the data as well, but mainly used for archiving adopted cats, ordering microchip identifiers and applying for pet licenses.</p>
        <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div><p class="case-study-paragraph">There were pain points at every stage.</p>

        <div class="large-spacing"></div>
        <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Visualizing Relationships Between Stages</h1>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">It was obvious that there would be pain points at every stage but after the interviews, it was clear <b>there were pain points in between the stages</b> too.</p>
        <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div><p class="case-study-paragraph">We learned that every stage had a couple volunteer leads, and they had <b>developed their own processes that suited their own team</b>.</p>
        <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div><p class="case-study-paragraph">This meant that no one knew about what happened outside their team, and how their actions could affect other teams.</p>
        <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div><p class="case-study-paragraph">Since I learned about service design at my internship at Shopify, I led the creation of a service design blueprint to help our team and the volunteers visualize the relationships between each stage.</p>

          <p class="text-image-card-paragraph-small">Around 5-10 cats are ‚Äúlost‚Äù every month. One of the leads we spoke to is in charge of finding out what happened. Sometimes cats are linked to the wrong adopter or the data is entered incorrectly.</p>
