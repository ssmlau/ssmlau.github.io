    <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph"><b>Timeline</b>: 1 month</p>
    <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph"><b>Team</b>: UW Blueprint Club - 3 developers, 1 other designer (his feature not shown)</p>

            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Introduction</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">This mobile app was designed and built for Friends of the Earth Canada, an non-profit organization focusing on environmental conservation. This was one of the projects for UW Blueprint, a group of students at the University of Waterloo dedicated to building technology for social good - free of charge.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Problem</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">One of organization’s initiatives is The Bee Cause which aims to raise awareness about the importance of bee diversity and preservation. The UK chapter already has a mobile app that teaches users about ways to protect bumble bee habitats and collects sighting data from users for scientists to analyze bee population and migration patterns. The current solution for the Canadian chapter is a lengthy web form for the submission process and other links on their website on other ways people can help protect bees.

            </p>
          </div>


          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">My Role</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">The part of the problem I worked on was the educational aspect of teaching app users how to be more bee-friendly in their daily lives and to solve how to motivate them. The submission process was worked on by another part of the team.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="portfolio-section">
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-caps-heading">UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</h1>
            <h1 class="portfolio-section-sub-heading">Research</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">The research started with a phone call with a member of the organization who was involved with The Bee Cause to ask about target demographic, the existing solution and pain points, what they imagined for the new solution and a walk through of how it works.
              <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">Initial Call Notes </p>
              <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">(For the part I was working on, some of the information I gathered) </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Current way of educating users on how to help bees are links to pdfs on website, presented after bee sighting submission (web form)</li>
                 <li>Submissions are from users age 24-55, typically female</li>
                  <li>This app should be designed for users that are new to the app world, should be simple to use</li>
                  <li>The learn feature should have tips similar to the provided list (image below)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tip sheets on how to take good pictures of bees</li>
                    <li>Gardening tips on creating a Bee&Bee</li>
                    <li>Long guide books, want to break down into small tips</li>
                    <li>Learn feature should motivate users to help (possibly gamification aspect)</li>

            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">The 3 main colours that we chose were blue, yellow and green. Green is the colour of the global organization logo, and the yellow is on most promotional materials on their pamphlets so we wanted to keep consistent branding. The blue is another colour they tend to use on their website for the water of the earth and other links. We kept the colours bright so the app looks more fun and engaging.

To keep users motivated, they will have a “level” that is related to how many tasks they completed.

            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">After getting feedback for the submission flow and learn feature, our team restructured the navigation of the app to have Home, Capture and Me. The Learn feature now lives under the Me tab which is a profile page that also keeps track of all bee sighting submissions. <br><br>
For iteration 2, since the page is being shared with sightings, I moved the active and completed challenges into a segmented tab bar. I also changed the copy to specify how many tasks were needed to achieve the next level since previously, the wording was ambigious.
